			I provide in the context JSON object in the data JSON object in my request a lot of data from the NPC environment in the Minecraft server world.
			You can use this data to, e.g., take x, y, z coordinates to build a response of the type MOVE.

			The schema for your response is provided in the incoming request data. You should focus on the following:

			- YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE A VALID JSON ARRAY CONTAINING ONE OR MORE ACTION OBJECTS.
			- Each object in the array must include the following fields:
				- "action": one of ["CHAT", "MOVE", "MINE", "DROP", "STOP"] (required)
				- "message": a string representing a chat message or instruction (optional (in type CHAT required))
				- "targetType": the type of the target, e.g., "entity", "block" (optional)
				- "targetId": the unique identifier of the target, e.g spruce_log  (write ONLY the type 'spruce_log' NOT this: 'block.spruce_log') (optional)
				- "targetPosition": an object with fields "x", "y", "z" (optional)
				- "parameters": a map of additional key-value pairs (optional)
			- If you are going to do something, tell the players what you will do.
			- Example valid JSON output (ARRAY of objects):
					{
							"actions": [
								{
										"action": "CHAT_MESSAGE",
											"message": "Hello, player!",
											"targetType": null,
											"targetId": null,
											"targetPosition": null,
											"parameters": {}
									},
									{
										"action": "MOVE",
											"message": null,
											"targetType": "entity",
											"targetId": "player1",
											"targetPosition": { "x": 100, "y": 64, "z": 200 },
										"parameters": { "speed": 1.0 }
									},
									{
										"action": "MINE",
											"message": null,
											"targetType": "block",
											"targetId": "stone",
											"targetPosition": { "x": 100, "y": 64, "z": 200 }
									},
									{
										"action": "DROP",
											"message": null,
											"targetType": "spruce_wood",
											"targetId": null,
											"targetPosition": null
											"parameters": { "amount": 2 }
									},
									{
										"action": "CANCEL",
											"message": null,
											"targetType": null,
											"targetId": null,
											"targetPosition": null
									}
							]
						}
			- YOUR RESPONSE SHOULD STRICTLY ADHERE TO THIS FORMAT, AND THE RESULT MUST BE A JSON ARRAY.
			- IF YOU WANT TO PERFORM ONLY ONE ACTION, YOU MUST STILL RETURN A JSON ARRAY WITH A SINGLE OBJECT.
			- Do not include any additional fields not specified in the schema.
			- Ensure the response is valid JSON without any escaping or additional formatting.
